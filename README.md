# Frontend (Angular)

This is an angular frontent app that works with the [this](https://github.com/Bernasss12/backend-spring-boot) project.
This is the frontend code I ended up with for the tutorial video series found [here](https://youtu.be/Gzk4cc8LTQs)

## Setup
To set this up on your computer you should only have to change the api url that is hardcoded [here](https://github.com/Bernasss12/frontend-angular/blob/8034de20b12dfc9f2fd7fd15df8127dfe65d70df/src/app/employee.service.ts#L11) to where your spring boot server is running.


## I will leave the autogenerated stuff below here.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.8.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
